# Mithril-Portal

Mithril component for rendering components at different mount points

## Why

Mithril-portal mounts a component/children to a `div` that is appended to `document.body`. This is useful for UI related components such as modals, popovers, dropdowns, etc. where rendering inline would cause css overflow/ z-index issues.

 ## Installation

```
npm install --save mithril-portal
```
